# ortholog_identifier
Wrapper script for the tool proteinortho, which identified orthologs between multiple sequenced genomes. Used here for amino acid sequences.
Simple python script for consolidated commands in Proteinortho V. 5.11. Also deals with identical protein identifiers in different genomes 
(as for closely related strains) and outputs a .annote file with original protein annotations and unique cluster identifiers.
